# Sleeve and Cotter Joint Assembly

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates a **Sleeve and Cotter Joint Assembly** created in SolidWorks 2023.  
The model shows the connection of two coaxial rods using a sleeve and cotter arrangement.  
This joint is widely used in mechanical engineering for connecting round rods subjected to axial forces.

## 📂 Contents
- `/Assembly.sldasm` → Main assembly file  
- `/Parts` → Individual part models (`Sleeve.sldprt`, `Rod.sldprt`, `Cotter.sldprt`, etc.)  
- `/Drawings` → SolidWorks drawing files + PDF export  
- `/Exports` → STEP/IGES files for universal CAD software  
- `/Images` → Screenshots and rendered previews of the assembly  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- SolidWorks 2023  
- SolidWorks Motion/Assembly Mates  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of **cotter and sleeve joints** in machine design  
- Use of **assembly constraints** in SolidWorks  
- Exporting and documenting CAD projects for sharing
